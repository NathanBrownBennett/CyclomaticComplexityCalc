# CyclomaticComplexityCalc

## Overview

CyclomaticComplexityCalc is a web-based tool that calculates the Cyclomatic Complexity of given code snippets or files. This tool supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, Java, C#, and Python, allowing developers to assess the complexity of their code effectively. By measuring Cyclomatic Complexity, developers can identify potentially problematic areas of their code that might be difficult to test or maintain.

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support:** Calculate Cyclomatic Complexity for C, C++, Java, C#, and Python files.
- **File Upload:** Users can upload code files directly for complexity analysis.
- **Visual Interface:** A user-friendly web interface to input code snippets and receive complexity metrics.
- **Resources:** Includes educational resources on Cyclomatic Complexity and its importance in software development.

## Installation

To set up the CyclomaticComplexityCalc application locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

After moving into the directory of the downloaded project, follow the following steps:

'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
4. Run the application:
'''
python app.py
'''

5. Access the web interface through your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- **Calculate Complexity:** Navigate to the main page, upload a code file or paste your code snippet into the designated area, and submit it for analysis. The tool will display the Cyclomatic Complexity of the submitted code.
- **Learn:** Visit the About Us and Privacy pages to learn more about Cyclomatic Complexity and how your data is handled.
